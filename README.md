## DATASET
***
**Periapical X-rays Data set. Kaggle.** <br />
[2021 – Current] <br />
This dataset was gathered from the Armed Forces Institute of Dentistry Rawalpindi (AFID) in Pakistan. Due to the laborious and time-consuming nature of labeling, only 534 periapical X-rays were labelled by skilled radiologists and dentists. However, we plan to release additional versions with a larger number of X-rays in the near future. <br/>
